Korean spicy garlic fried chicken
Serves 4. Prep/ cook time: 2-3 hours

Ingredients - chicken marinade

•	⁠500 grams skinless and boneless chicken thigh fillets chopped into bite size pieces
•	⁠3 cm piece of ginger peeled and grated
•	⁠2 tbsp soy sauce
•	⁠2 tbsp mirin
•	⁠1/2 teaspoon of black pepper

Mix the above ingredients in a large bowl and leave to marinate in the fridge for 1 hour.

Ingredients - chilli oil

•	⁠60ml vegetable oil
•	⁠5 garlic cloves, cut in half
•	⁠2cm piece of ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
•	⁠1 leek, white part only, cut into strip's
•	⁠1 tbsp dried chilli flakes

(To make it more spicy, I would double the quantity of chilli oil.) First, heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger and stir fry for 2 minutes or until garlic is charred. Add the leek and fry for another 3 minutes or until leek is crispy. Use tongs to remove garlic, ginger and leek from hot oil and reserve. Add the chilli flakes to the hot oil and cook for 1 minute. Strain the oil through a sieve into a bowl and set aside. Discard the chilli flakes.

Ingredients - frying chicken

•	⁠180 grams potato starch or corn starch
•	⁠1 egg
•	⁠vegetable oil for frying
•	⁠1/2 onion diced
•	⁠5 dried red chillies cut into 2 cm pieces
•	⁠1 spring onion, thinly sliced
•	⁠2 tbsp soy sauce
•	⁠2 tbsp caster sugar
•	⁠1 tbsp white vinegar
•	⁠1 tbsp cornflour mixed with 60 ml water
•	⁠50 grams peanuts, skinned and toasted

Add potato starch and egg to chicken and use your hands to massage the chicken until coated.

Heat 2.5 cm vegetable oil in a wok over medium to high heat until it reaches 175 degrees Celsius. Fry the chicken in batches and turn occasionally until it is golden and crunchy, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken and transfer to a wire rack or plate with paper towel to catch excess oil.

Pour the oil out of the wok and wipe clean with paper towel. Heat the chilli oil in the same wok over medium to high heat. Add the onion and stir fry for 2 minutes or until soft. Add the dried chillies and spring onion and stir fry for another minute. Add the soy sauce, sugar and white vinegar, and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the cornflour mixture into the sauce and stir continuously until smooth and the sauce has thickened.

Return the chicken, fried garlic, ginger and leek into the wok and stir in the peanuts. Mix until the chicken is nicely coated in the sauce, then transfer to a serving plate with rice and a nice cold beer.
